## About Me

Hi, I’m **Ichsan Hibatullah** — currently a Data Management Intern at [JOB Pertamina–Medco E&P Tomori Sulawesi](https://id.linkedin.com/company/job-pertamina-medco-e-&-p-tomori-sulawesi) in Jakarta, where I help build and QA‑test a web app for subsurface data management and integrate machine‑learning modules for synthetic sonic logs. Prior to this, I worked as a Research Geophysicist at the Geoseismal Research Center, collaborating with Pertamina Hulu Mahakam (PHM) and Pertamina Hulu Rokan (PHR) on ML‑driven pore‑pressure, fault‑analysis, and fluid‑classification projects, and developing backend modules for Web-based Application and in Dataiku. I also interned at Pusat Survei Geologi (PSG), where I created open‑source Python packages (like **lfpspy**), a package for passive seismic method processing.

I hold a B.Sc. in Geophysics (Science) from Gadjah Mada University and completed a Machine Learning Specialization through Bangkit, on Independent Study Program. My passion lies at the intersection of computational geophysics and data science — I specialize in Python, C#, SQL, and ML frameworks to turn raw subsurface data into actionable insights.

This site is a living portfolio of my work:  
- 🔭 [Projects](/portfolio/) that showcase my coding and research.  
- 📚 [Publications](/publications/) on geophysics and ML methods.  
- 📝 [Blog Posts](/year-archive/) where I share tutorials and lessons learned.  
- 📄 A dynamically‑generated [CV](/cv/) with my full background.
