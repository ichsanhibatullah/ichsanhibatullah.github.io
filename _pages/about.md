## About Me

Hi, I’m **Ichsan Hibatullah** — currently a Data Management Intern at [JOB Pertamina–Medco E&P Tomori Sulawesi](https://id.linkedin.com/company/job-pertamina-medco-e-&-p-tomori-sulawesi) in Jakarta, where I help QA‑test a web app for subsurface data management and experiment with machine learning for synthetic data generation to provide insightful subsurface data. Prior to this, I worked as a Research Geophysicist at the Geoseismal Research Center, collaborating with Pertamina Hulu Mahakam (PHM) and Pertamina Hulu Rokan (PHR) on ML‑driven pore‑pressure, fault‑analysis, and fluid‑classification projects, and developing backend modules for Web-based Application and in Dataiku. I also interned at Pusat Survei Geologi (PSG), where I created open‑source Python packages (like **lfpspy**), a package for passive seismic method processing.

I hold a B.Sc. in Geophysics (Science) from Gadjah Mada University and completed a Machine Learning Specialization through Bangkit, on Independent Study Program. My passion lies at the intersection of computational geophysics and data science — I specialize in Python and machine learning frameworks to turn raw subsurface data into actionable insights. I'm currently learning C#, SQL, and Power BI to deepen my expertise and broaden my capabilities in data analysis and visualization.

This site is a living portfolio of my work, consisting:  
- 📝 [Blog Posts](/year-archive/) where I share my activities and lessons learned.  
- 🔭 [Projects](/portfolio/) that showcase my research project and experiment.  
- 📚 [Publications](/publications/) on Geoscience and Artifical Intelligence (AI) domain knowledge.  
- 📄 [CV](/cv/) that dynamically‑generated with my full background.
